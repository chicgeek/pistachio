<p class="cd-text">These are the font awesome icons that we use which cover most requirements. A full list can be found at <a href="https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/icons/">the font awesome site</a> but care should be taken to stick to this list and avoid using slightly different icons for the same function. Consistency is important.</p>
<p class="cd-text">Use icons sparingly and always provide a text description. Never use an icon on it's own.</p>
